#DESCRIPTION OF CURRENT TARGET
Create 3d wave based survival action game with a controllable player that fights through progressively harder waves of enemies across different biomes. Core loop is revolved around fast-pace combat, character abilities, and long-term progression through XP and upgrades.

The game takes place on even-ground arena - starting with a park surrounded by buildings

The waves of enemies progressively increase in difficulty. Main type of enemy with low health spawn that all target the player. Gets more difficult over time with health, speed, damage, and spawn rate. Boss mobs spawn every so many rounds of waves?

Combat features: One character very basic weapon type to start progressively gain loot from random chests and a trader that have equipment that have different attack types and do more damage. (td: Approach for progressively better gear)

Players gain XP by killing mobs and getting to end of waves. XP gets you level ups giving you skill points that you can spend on upgrading different attributes. Temporary power ups?

In game hud with health, xp level, inventory tab to see stats and equipment
